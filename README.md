# PumaVario

PumaVario is a variometer made for paragliding.


Actual hardware is based around the LILYGO TTGO T5 esp32 e-paper module. (more info: https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-T5-Epaper-Series)
It has a MS5611 barometer, for vario; a MPU9250 accelerometer, gyroscope, compass for heading, Gs info, more precise vario? a NEO-6M for speed, altitude, distance traveled etc (may need to be upgraded to a 8M for more precise data)
